Time Complexity
    Time taken (no of oprations done) by the algo to run for a given input n

    F(input length ) => time taken 


Graphs > operations (prop. to ) length of input


Big O       > upper bound               [Worst Case]
Big Theta   > range(so it is average)   [Avg Case]
Big Omega   > lower bound               [Best Case]

STEP >>

1)INPUTS : take a note of INPUTS




NOTE :  Number of times, you can double a number till it is less than n would be log(n).
